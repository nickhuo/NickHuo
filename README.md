I went to college in Shenzhen, shaped by its tech-driven momentum. From sandbox math models tackling supply chain and finance challenges, to driving 0-to-1 growth at Sonic SVM and scaling monetization at Tencent and Baidu. Now at UIUC, I’m building agents, driven by deep product thinking and technical innovation.

Here are all about this formula, the compound interest formula:

$$
FutureValue = PresentValue \left(1 + i\right)^{t}
$$

- $PresentValue$ is who I am today. I stand here because of [all the connected dots](https://www.notion.so/1f7d494f568380319a65e8617d7949f4?pvs=21) behind me: choices made, paths taken, and lessons learned.
- $i$ is growth rate. It fluctuates—sometimes slow, sometimes steep—but I stay in the game, always learning, always compounding.
- $t$ is time—the most important variable. The faster I move, the faster I learn. Acting early means more cycles, more feedback, more evolution. No one leaps to the top in one jump.
